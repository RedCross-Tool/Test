            <h4>Survey Methodology</h4>
            <p>Study Design: Community-based, cross-sectional survey.</p>
            <p>Study Setting: First, choose a district from a certain country, and then focus on a particular region in the selected district.</p>
            <p>Sample Size: Determine the target population within the chosen area and calculate the sample size using probability proportional to size (PPS) sampling based on the population and the desired level of precision. The formula for calculating the sample size for your survey so that the results are statistically significant is: n=N/(1+N(e^2))</p>
            <p>where:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>n is the sample size</li>
                <li>N is the population size</li>
                <li>e is the level of precision (often called the margin of error)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Sampling Technique: Multi-stage random sampling to select participating wards and households.</p>
            <p>Recruitment: A standard questionnaire is distributed to either the head of the household or to adult residents to collect information on family characteristics, climate change perceptions, and adaptation strategies.</p>
            <p>Data Analysis: The recommended Data collection tool to be used is the Microsoft forms or KOBO tool, which will be entered into a statistical package or Microsoft Excel and then presented in tables, graphs, and charts.</p>

            <h4>Health Facilities Vulnerability Assessment Methodology</h4>
            <p>This component represents a full-fledged checklist of vulnerability of health facilities as identified by the World Health Organization (WHO). It classifies different climate hazards and their corresponding health impacts then lists the criteria and questions to determine the readiness and robustness of health facilities. This checklist when used by researchers and analysts will help in a more systematic collection of data, and determination of risks and effects of various climate hazards. This is a more systematic way of approaching the vulnerabilities in health facilities and thus leads to better risk management and adaptation decisions.</p>

            <p>This table provides a systematic approach for identifying the types of data required for analysing trends in climate hazards and their explanations. It helps in identifying the data that needs to be tracked and evaluated for every climate hazard of concern. Using this table, researchers and analysts can consistently obtain the right data to make evaluations of the effects and trends of the various climate hazards. This is a more systematic way of approaching the analysis of the hazards with the aim of having a better understanding of the hazards and their risks and thus being in a better position to mitigate the risks in question in the best way possible as far as climate risk management and adaptation are concerned.</p>
